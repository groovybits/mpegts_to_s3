# Description: Record/Playback API Server Manager configuration file
#
# The capture/playback is composed of two parts:
# 1. The UDP to HLS server that records the incoming UDP stream and saves it to an S3 bucket.
# 2. The HLS to UDP server that plays back the recorded stream from the S3 bucket to the UDP client.
#
# The Manager and Agent parts of the recording-playback-server are used to manage the recording and playback processes.
# The Manager is responsible for starting and stopping the recording and playback processes.
# The Agent is responsible for recording and playing back the stream.
